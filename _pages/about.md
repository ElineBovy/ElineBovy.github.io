I am a PhD candidate at the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/'>Software Science</a> department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. I am supervised by Prof.dr. Nils Jansen. Before starting my PhD in March 2023, I followed the bachelors and masters Computing Science at the Radboud University, with a specialization in Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science.

My main research interest and conviently the topic of my PhD trajectory is planning and verification under uncertainty. More specifically, I look at extensions of Markov decision processes (MDPs) that add model uncertainty, such as robust MDPs and robust partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). My current work focuses on the semantics of robust POMDPs, assumptions made about uncertainty in robust (PO)MDPs, and the link between the uncertain models and stochastic games.
